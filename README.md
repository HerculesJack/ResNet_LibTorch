# ResNet_LibTorch
A small example of using new PyTorch C++ frontend to implement ResNet.

Inspired by the [example](https://github.com/goldsborough/examples/tree/cpp/cpp) suggested by the official PyTorch c++ doc, I spent a weekend writing a small example of ResNet.

You may need to:
* Update your CMake to the lastest (Mine is 3.12). I started with version 3.5 and it could not work.
